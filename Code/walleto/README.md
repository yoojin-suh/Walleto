Welcome to Walleto! This is a digital budget management application built with Next.js. Follow the simple steps below to get it running on your computer.

## What You Need Before Starting

Make sure you have these installed on your computer:
- **Node.js** (version 18 or newer) - Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** - Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

## How to Get the Project on Your Computer

### Option 1: Fork the Repository (Recommended for Team Members)
1. Go to the main project page on GitHub
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates your own copy of the project
4. Open your terminal/command prompt
5. Type this command (replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username):
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Walleto/Code/walleto.git
   ```

### Option 2: Clone Directly

## How to Run the Project

1. **Go into the project folder:**
   ```
   cd walleto
   ```

2. **Install all the required packages:**
   ```
   npm install

   Wait for this to finish - it might take a few minutes.

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your web browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000

1. Make sure Node.js is properly installed by typing `node --version` in your terminal
2. Make sure you're in the right folder (`walleto`)
3. Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again
4. Ask a team member for help!
